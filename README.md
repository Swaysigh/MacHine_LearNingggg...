# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

Welcome to my repository of machine learning algorithms. This project is a personal collection of code for learning and demonstrating various ML techniques from scratch or using common libraries.

## 🗂️ Table of Contents

This repository is organized into two main categories:

1.  [**Supervised Learning**](#-supervised-learning)
2.  [**Unsupervised Learning**](#-unsupervised-learning)

## 📈 Supervised Learning
**(Folder: `SuPervised_Learnnggg`)**

These algorithms learn from data that is already labeled with the correct outcome.

* **[Algorithm Name 1]**
    * **Description:** (e.g., "A model to predict continuous values based on input features.")
    * **File:** `SuPervised_Learnnggg/linear_regression.py` (Change this to your file path)
* **[Algorithm Name 2]**
    * **Description:** (e.g., "A classification model for binary outcomes.")
    * **File:** `SuPervised_Learnnggg/logistic_regression.py`
* *(...add more as you complete them!)*

## 📉 Unsupervised Learning
**(Folder: `UnSuPervised_Learnnggg`)**

These algorithms are used to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in unlabeled data.

* **[Algorithm Name 1]**
    * **Description:** (e.g., "An algorithm to partition data into 'k' distinct clusters.")
    * **File:** `UnSuPervised_Learnnggg/k_means.py`
* *(...add more!)*
